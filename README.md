# Chest CT-Scan Images Dataset

## Overview

The Chest CT-Scan images dataset is a comprehensive collection curated for a machine learning and deep learning project focused on the detection of chest cancer. The dataset includes images in JPG or PNG format, categorized into three distinct chest cancer types:

- [Adenocarcinoma](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images/data)
- [Large cell carcinoma](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images/data)
- [Squamous cell carcinoma](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images/data)

Additionally, a folder contains normal CT-scan images for reference. The dataset is organized into three main subsets:

- **Training (70%)**
- **Testing (20%)**
- **Validation (10%)**

## Project Details

The project employs an ensemble model for chest cancer detection, combining the power of EfficientNetB3, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 architectures. Through meticulous integration, the ensemble model achieves a remarkable test accuracy of 90.28% and a test loss of 0.42. This collaborative approach enhances the overall performance and robustness of the classification, harnessing the unique strengths of each individual model. The aim is to provide accurate diagnoses, insightful information about the cancer type, and recommended treatment strategies based on the comprehensive analysis of chest CT-scan images.

## About Chest Cancer Types

1. **Adenocarcinoma:** The most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 30 percent of all cases overall and about 40 percent of all non-small cell lung cancer occurrences. Adenocarcinomas are found in the outer region of the lung in glands that secrete mucus.

2. **Large cell carcinoma:** Grows and spreads quickly, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of all cases of non-small cell lung cancer. It can be found anywhere in the lung.

3. **Squamous cell carcinoma:** Found centrally in the lung, responsible for about 30 percent of all non-small cell lung cancers, and generally linked to smoking.
